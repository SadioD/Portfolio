                  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, a Master's degree in Sales 
                  Management and another one in Web Marketing.
                  Thanks to my professional background, I have been able to develop key skills in the areas 
                  of IT, Marketing and Project Management. Indeed, I’m good at designing and building websites, 
                  eveloping cross platform mobile Apps. I am also capable of developing and implementing 
                  effective marketing strategies both online (building SEO-friendly websites, growing visibility
                  in organic search engine results by improving search engine rankings, Web Marketing) and 
                  offline (business plan for startup projects or product launch plan, traditional Marketing).
